# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the Project

The **"Multi Step Form"** challenge from Frontend Mentor was an exercise in creating a user-friendly, multi-step form experience.

This project was built using Vite for development efficiency, React for its component architecture, framer-motion for smooth entry animations, TypeScript for type safety, and Scss for styling.

The form data is managed through React's Context API, ensuring state is easily accessible across components, and stored in local storage for persistence across page refreshes.

Note that some coding decisions might reflect an amateur approach, as this was developed during my learning phase with these technologies.
